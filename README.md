# LungScope-Uncovering-Patterns-in-Lung-Cancer-Progression
🎯 1. Project Objective  To analyze and visualize lung cancer trends and risk factors using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The goal is to uncover correlations between environmental, genetic, and behavioral risk factors and their impact on cancer stage and survival — ultimately guiding better screening and healthcare awareness.
🧾 2. CSV File Component Explanation

The dataset Lung_Cancer_Trends_Realistic.csv has 3000 rows and 24 columns, each representing patient-level lung cancer information. Here’s what key components mean:
# Patient_ID
Unique identifier for each patient
# Age, Gender
Demographic information
# Smoking_Status, Years_Smoking, Cigarettes_Per_Day
Smoking habits
# Secondhand_Smoke_Exposure, Occupation_Exposure, Air_Pollution_Level
Environmental exposure
# Family_History, Genetic_Markers_Positive
Genetic predispositions
# BMI, Physical_Activity_Level, Alcohol_Consumption, Diet_Quality
Lifestyle factors
# Region, Income_Level, Education_Level, Access_to_Healthcare, Screening_Frequency
Socioeconomic and healthcare access data
# Chronic_Lung_Disease
Indicates comorbidity
# Lung_Cancer_Stage
Stage I to IV or None
# Diagnosis_Year
Year of diagnosis
# Survival_Status
“Alive” or “Deceased”

📈 3. What the Outcome Suggests

🔍 Major Findings:
	•	Stage III/IV patients smoke more on average → strong association between prolonged smoking and disease severity.
	•	Secondhand smoke and air pollution are prevalent across all stages, indicating environmental impact.
	•	Access to healthcare and lifestyle (diet, exercise) vary, hinting at their possible roles in early detection or prevention.
	•	The correlation heatmap can reveal hidden relationships — e.g., poor screening + low education = higher cancer stage.

⸻

🧠 Final Interpretation:

This project shows how early detection, healthy habits, and access to healthcare strongly influence lung cancer outcomes. It confirms known risk factors and gives a real-world data-backed view into how lifestyle and environment contribute to the disease.
